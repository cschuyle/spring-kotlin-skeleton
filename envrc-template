# This file can be used to set up your env vars to run locally.
# You will need access to credentials to a PostgreSQL database 0 either local or in the cloud.
#
# Usage:
# You can need to copy this to another file (for example .envrc, which is in .gitignore,
# so that's a little safer than editing it in place), then edit the credentials to be your own.
# Then source the file (source .envrc) to set the env vars before running the app.

# If you use a real database instead of h2, you need creds.
# Uncomment postgres dependency an comment h2 dependency in build.gradle.kts, and the below:
#
# host='PSQL_HOST_NAME'
# database='PSQL_DATABASE_NAME'
# user='PSQL_USERNAME'
# port=PSQL_PORT
# password='PSQL_PASSWORD'
#
# # These are the env vars for Spring
# export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://$host/$database"
# export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME="$user"
# export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="$password"
#
# # This is the DB URI - not for Spring, but for other stuff
# export PSQL_URI="postgres://$user:$password@host:$port/$database"
